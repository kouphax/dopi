# Authboss Sample
A sample implementer of authboss.

This is a simple blogging engine with a few basic features:

- Authentication provided by Authboss (all modules enabled, despite conflict between remember & expire)
- Overridden (pretified) Authboss views.
- CRUD for an in-memory storage of blogs.
- Flash Messages
- XSRF Protection

**Disclaimer:** This sample is NOT a seed project. Do not use it as one. It is used as an example of how to use the Authboss API.
This means if you copy-paste code from this sample you are likely opening yourself up to various security holes, bad practice,
and bad design. It's a demonstration of the surface API of Authboss and how the library can be used to make a functioning web
project, to use this sample as anything else is malpractice.
